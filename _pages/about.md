Iâ€™m an Assistant Professor in the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh and the a co-director of the [Social Media Analysis and Support for Humanity (SMASH)](https://smash.inf.ed.ac.uk) group. 
My research focuses on computational approaches to understand and counter social media manipulation. I use a combination of data science, NLP, and network science methods to conduct my research.

I am looking for PhD students to work with in the academic year of 2024-2025. Feel free to get in touch if you are interested in working with me: tugrulcanelmas at gmail.com

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Scholar at Indiana University at Bloomington working with Prof. Dr. Filippo Menczer and Prof. Dr. Alessandro Flammini at Observatory on Social Media (OSOME). 
I received my Ph.D. from EPFL, under supervision of Prof. Dr. Karl Aberer in 2022, and my B.S. from Bilkent University in 2017, with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Philosophy.
